                    <p>Hi! I am Deryn Boscariol, an aspiring web developer. Born and raised in the GTA and currently living in downtown Toronto, I have always had a passion for innovation and emerging technologies. This lead me to Toronto Metropolitan Universityâ€™s New Media program where I further explored technology and the creativity that can be fostered through it. After completing my Bachelor of Fine Arts I decided to enter the web development industry and pursue technical training at Humber College in the Web Development Graduate Studies Certificate program. I am excited by the dynamic and flourishing industry that web design and development has become and I am eager to establish my position within it. </p>
